# aurora-app

The Nuxt 4 web app for Aurora. Owns the Twilio WhatsApp webhook and sends
replies — the actual "thinking" happens in a separate Trigger.dev project.
Deployed on AWS Amplify, where SSR runs on Lambda: the execution environment
freezes as soon as a response is returned, so nothing in this app can defer
work past a request (no timers, no background promises, no polling). All
long-running work happens in Trigger.dev instead.

## What this app does

`capture-agent` (in [aurora-agents](https://github.com/sahildavid-dev/aurora-agents))
identifies a real-world place from a name/description, a Google Maps link,
and/or a photo, and returns structured place data for Aurora's map — it's a
"save this place" pipeline, not a general Q&A bot, and it doesn't (yet)
support follow-up conversation about something already captured. A run
takes 30-90 seconds (multiple web searches at high effort) — far past
Twilio's 15-second webhook timeout — so the webhook only ever hands off and
returns; the reply comes back out-of-band once the agent is done.

1. Receives an inbound WhatsApp message via a Twilio webhook, downloads any
   attached photo, and triggers `capture-agent` with the raw message.
2. `capture-agent` does its own interpretation of the text/image, resolves
   the place, and calls back into this app to send the WhatsApp reply.

```
WhatsApp user → Twilio → aurora-app (this repo) → Trigger.dev capture-agent → Claude
      ↑                       ↑                              │
      └── Twilio REST API ────┴── POST /api/internal/notify ──┘
```

## Integration contract

Trigger `capture-agent` with the raw inbound message, untouched — no URL
extraction, no splitting text into name vs. notes; the agent's model does
that interpretation itself:

```ts
{
  from: string          // body.From
  messageSid: string     // body.MessageSid
  receivedAt: string     // ISO timestamp
  text: string           // body.Body, trimmed; may be empty for a bare photo
  image?: { data: string; mediaType: string }   // base64
}
```

Triggered with `MessageSid` as the idempotency key, so a Twilio retry of the
same message returns the existing run instead of starting a second paid
one. This app never reads the run's result — `capture-agent` sends its own
reply (see below). The payload shape is mirrored from the actual schema in
[`aurora-agents/src/trigger/capture-agent.ts`](../aurora-agents/src/trigger/capture-agent.ts)
(both repos live under the same `AURORA/` parent directory on this
machine) — treat that file as the source of truth. This app doesn't need an
Anthropic key — only `aurora-agents` talks to Claude.

- `image: { data, mediaType }` — `data` is base64, `mediaType` is one of
  `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`. Twilio reports
  attachments as separate `MediaUrl{n}`/`MediaContentType{n}` fields, each
  only fetchable with Twilio-authenticated requests. Since `aurora-agents`
  deliberately has no Twilio credentials, this app downloads the first
  supported attachment and inlines it as base64 instead of passing the
  Twilio URL through. Only the first supported image is fetched, capped at
  5MB raw (base64 inflates ~33%, and Trigger.dev's payload limit is 10MB);
  anything over the cap, or any non-image attachment, is dropped.

### Reply path

`capture-agent` can't call Twilio directly (it holds no Twilio credentials),
and the webhook can't wait for it (15s timeout vs. a 30-90s run), so it
sends its reply by calling back into this app:

```
POST /api/internal/notify
Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_API_SECRET>
{ "to": "whatsapp:+1...", "body": "..." }
```

- `to` must start with `whatsapp:` (rejected otherwise, so a leaked secret
  can't be used to send arbitrary SMS through this account).
- `body` is truncated to Twilio's 1600-character message limit rather than
  rejected if longer.
- Authenticated with a shared bearer secret (`INTERNAL_API_SECRET`),
  compared in constant time. This is a general-purpose internal auth guard
  ([`server/utils/internalAuth.ts`](./server/utils/internalAuth.ts)) meant
  to be reused by future agent-to-app endpoints (e.g. place writes), not
  something specific to notify.

## Stack

Nuxt 4. Two Nitro server routes:

[`server/api/webhooks/twilio.post.ts`](./server/api/webhooks/twilio.post.ts) —
the inbound Twilio webhook. Thin and stateless by necessity (see the Lambda
note above — no in-process dedupe/debounce/queueing survives between
invocations):

- Verifies the Twilio request signature. Amplify sits behind CloudFront, so
  the request URL the handler sees isn't the public one Twilio signed
  against — the signed URL is rebuilt from `PUBLIC_URL` instead, preserving
  the actual request's path and query string. Fails closed (500, not a
  silent skip) if `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` isn't configured.
- Downloads the first supported image attachment, if any.
- Triggers `capture-agent` and acks Twilio immediately with an empty 200
  (no TwiML, so Twilio doesn't auto-reply) — it never waits on the run.
- A message missing `From`/`MessageSid`/(text and media) is logged and
  acked with a plain 200 rather than a 4xx, since a 4xx would just earn
  pointless Twilio retries for a message that can never succeed. A media
  download or trigger failure is left to throw a 5xx — Twilio retries, and
  the `MessageSid` idempotency key prevents a duplicate paid run.

[`server/api/internal/notify.post.ts`](./server/api/internal/notify.post.ts) —
the reply path `capture-agent` calls back into; see [Reply path](#reply-path)
above.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in Twilio + Trigger.dev + internal secret
npm run dev
```

Point a Twilio WhatsApp sender's webhook at `POST /api/webhooks/twilio` on a
publicly reachable URL (e.g. `ngrok http 3000` while developing) — that same
URL is also what `PUBLIC_URL` must be set to.

Required env vars (see `.env.example`), all needed at runtime, not just
build time:

- `PUBLIC_URL` — this app's public origin, e.g. `https://app.example.com`.
  Used to rebuild the URL Twilio signed against; must match the webhook URL
  configured in the Twilio console exactly.
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` — verify inbound webhook
  signatures, fetch media attachments, and send replies.
- `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` — the Twilio WhatsApp sender, e.g.
  `whatsapp:+14155238886`.
- `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY` — auth for triggering `capture-agent` in
  `aurora-agents`.
- `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` — shared bearer secret `capture-agent` presents when
  calling this app's internal endpoints (currently just `/api/internal/notify`).
  Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
